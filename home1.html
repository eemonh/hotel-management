                    <div class="box-detail">
                        <h3>Airport Transfers</h3>
<p>Please check with your agent that they have forwarded through your flight details. To reconfirm your transfers, please click hereto pre-register. &nbsp;Shared one way airport transfers are USD 45++ per adult and USD 22.50 for children per way. Shared transfers may mean that you need to wait for other guest to clear the airport. &nbsp;Private one way airport transfers are available at USD 75++ per adult and USD37.50++ for children.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Arriving</h3>
<p>When arriving, you will land on the airport island called Hulhule. The airport does not have air bridges and you can expect 30 degrees Celsius as soon as you leave the plane. Once you have cleared immigration, you will pass customs. Please note the very strict rules as mentioned below. Once you have cleared customs, one of our team members will be waiting with a Kurumba signboard. If the person is assisting another guest, please go to the Universal Resorts counter on the first row, number four. When all the guests on that flight have cleared customs, our team will take you to the Kurumba speedboat and your transfer will take approximately 10 minutes. When checking in, we will need your passport and if the accommodation expenses have not been prepaid, we kindly request you to settle within 24 hours of your arrival. If you have booked via an online travel agent, please ensure that you advise us of your flight details.</p>
<h3>Checking In</h3>
<p>Check-in time is 14:00. Early check-in can be arranged subject to availability for arrivals after 09:00. There are times when this is not possible as the outgoing guests are checking out at 12:00 but we will certainly do our best to have your room ready as soon as possible. A shower room and waiting lounge is available.</p>
<h3>Checking Out</h3>
<p>Checkout time is at 12:00. Late checkouts are subject to availability and can be confirmed the day prior to your departure. Late checkout fees apply. Kurumba provides a shower room and storage space if you would like to make the most of your day. Alternatively, there is a relaxation lounge near the library if you are looking for a quiet place to rest prior to your flight. Our team will leave a departure note&nbsp;for you to reconfirm your transfer and flight details the night prior to your departure. Maldives airport recommends being at the airport 3 hours prior to arrival and we normally organise transfers around 2.5 hours prior to your flight departure.</p>
<h3>Children Facilities</h3>
<p>Kurumba has good facilities for children. For further information, please click here to see the Children&rsquo;s fact sheet.</p>
<h3>Children's&nbsp;Behaviour&nbsp;</h3>
<p>It is important to respect the enjoyment of all guests and we request that children in restaurants and bars are to maintain a relaxed and peaceful behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Clothing</h3>
<p>Casual clothing is normal in the Maldives. Lightweight cotton and linen clothes are recommended. Items for ladies would be sundresses, kaftans, light shirts, sarongs &amp; skirts. If you plan to visit a local Island or Male&rsquo;, it is advisable to have your thighs and shoulders covered if visiting the inhabited local islands. For the men, light cotton shirts, shorts, pants, board shorts and some light and comfortable smart casual for evening wear. Whilst at Kurumba, most guests wear comfortable clothes throughout the day and night. Board shorts and bikinis are more than acceptable on the beach. Ladies can dress more freely and relaxed without feeling that you are offending anyone. Many guests wear slides or slippers which are more than acceptable at any time of the day. High heels are not required.</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>The average temperature is around 29/32&deg; Celsius. The wetter times are normally between May to June and September to November. These periods can be daily patches of light showers to good thunderstorms. The water temperature ranges from 24/30&deg; Celsius. Umbrellas are in every room so there is no need to pack an umbrella. During this time the water is warm and the fish do not seem to mind the rain.</p>
<h3>Currency</h3>
<p>The Maldivian currency is the Rufiyaa. The American dollar is the most commonly used foreign currency at Kurumba and in Male&rsquo; so there is no real reason to exchange or bring Maldivian Rufiyaa. It is important that the USD are new notes as local banks do not accept old or torn notes. Traveller&rsquo;s cheques are not accepted in the Maldives.</p>
<h3>Departure</h3>
<p>Our Kurumba team will send you a letter the day prior to your departure. It is recommended to complete the checkout the day prior if you have an early checkout to avoid any cashiering delays as bank credit card payments can be problematic. It is recommended to be at the airport three hours prior to departure and we schedule our transfers 2.5 hours prior to ensure that you make your flight.</p>
<h3>Dietary Requirements</h3>
<p>We are able to cater to a number of dietary requirements. Vegetarians, Vegans, Gluten Free, Halal and Jain can be catered for. Not all dishes are suitable for all guests and we request at least 48 hours notice. If you have any dietary requirements, please click hereto pre-register.</p>
<h3>Disabled Guests</h3>
<p>Please click here to see the disabled guests fact sheet.</p>
<h3>Electricity</h3>
<p>The electrical current is 230 volts &amp; 50Hz. This is a European three pin, type G or British Standard 1363.</p>
<h3>Health</h3>
<p>Kurumba has an in-house doctor that is on the Island 45 weeks of the year and 6 days per week. A decompression chamber for dive incidents is available within easy reach of Kurumba. We do recommend wearing mosquito repellent and sunscreens. In terms of vaccinations, we recommend that you research your countries government travel advice website.</p>

<h3>Local Time</h3>
<p>Kurumba Maldives is 9 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time and UTC/GMT + 5 hrs.</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Kurumba Maldives is conveniently located 10 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from Mal&eacute; capital. After a long flight, we are certain that you will appreciate arriving to the resort early and upon departure, you can stretch your stay at the resort until 3 hours prior to your flight's departure. The resort also provides shower facilities, a small waiting lounge and luggage storage during that period. You may expect some occasional airplane or seaplane sounds. Our location inspires us to offer more than resorts further afield with inclusions, small touches and surprises and a very competitive pricing compared to resorts of the same standard.&nbsp;Another advantage is that you will not miss your flights due to bad weather which can delay seaplanes and boat transfers from resorts further afield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our location also enables us to provide one of the best nightly entertainment programmes within the Maldives due to the proximity to the capital.</p>
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>We have a philosophy of continual improvement and maintenance is undertaken&nbsp;year round. This is to ensure that we can provide the best quality for our guests. Generally, this is completed in an understated manner to create minimal guest disturbance.</p>
<h3>Meal Plans</h3>
<p>Meal plans start and finish with the standard checking time of 14:00 and checkout time of 12:00. You can upgrade your meal plan on arrival and this will need to be for the duration of your stay.</p>
<h3>No Show / Shortening &amp; Reduction Of Stay</h3>
<p>100% Cancellation Fees. Guests are therefore urged to purchase a travel insurance policy covering refunds of cancellation deposits.</p>
<h3>Payment &amp; Money</h3>
<p>Please note that we accept cash payments in Euro, Sterling Pounds, US Dollars, Singapore Dollars, Australian Dollars, Japanese Yen and Maldivian Rufiyaa, however any change will be returned in US Dollars. Also accepted are Visa, MasterCard and American Express cards (Diners Club, Maestro and CUP credit cards not accepted). There is no need to exchange your currency into Maldivian Rufiyaa prior to arrival at the resort, as this may not be able to be converted back into your own currency. If you intend to pay in cash, the resort will only accept tender that is free of tears, fading or any other defects as per the guidelines of Maldives Banks. Traveller&rsquo;s cheques are not accepted by the banks.</p>
<h3>Pre-Registration</h3>
<p>Please feel free to pre-register and tell us about your dietary requirements, other preferences and reconfirming your travel times. This can also make the check in process a little more efficient; Please click here for our Pre-Registration page.</p>
<h3>Prices</h3>
<p>Please note that prices are subject to 23.2% Government Tax and Service Charge. Our on site prices can be found on the menus and flyers on this website.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Moderate Islam is practiced in the Maldives. Government regulations do not allow any form of other religious statues, monuments or celebrations within the Maldives.</p>
<h3>Room Requests</h3>
<p>We are more than happy for you to email and request specific rooms. We are unable to guarantee specific rooms due to other guests requests and that we normally allocate rooms that guests are departing on that day. We will do our best to fulfill your requests and your best option would be to give us three or four preferred rooms or approximate area. Please click here to complete our pre-registration form.</p>
<h3>Room Upgrades</h3>
<p>To upgrade your room, you are best to email our reservations team prior to your arrival or when you arrive. These upgrades are subject to availability and chargeable.</p>
<h3>Seawalls</h3>
<p>Kurumba is protected by seawalls around the island. This is a common practice in more and more resorts to preserve the beach from erosion all year round. At the same time, they allow a safe swimming experience for everyone, specially during windy and rough conditions and ensures that no strong currents are felt near the beach.</p>
<h3>Shopping</h3>
<p>The capital, Male&rsquo; stores are open between 08:30 and 22:00 and close during prayer times. On Friday, they open at 14:00 and close at 22:00. Kurumba&rsquo;s Nala Boutique by the Reception offers a range of swimwear, resort wear, gifts, toiletries, snacks, entertainment items, local arts and crafts in&nbsp;prices similar if not lower than Male&rsquo;.</p>
<h3>Travel Insurance</h3>
<p>The reality is that with any holiday, we should all strongly consider Travel Insurance.</p>
<h3>Telephones</h3>
<p>On Kurumba you will have the Dhiraggu telephone network. This operator uses a GSM 900 network, which is well-suited with many international cell phone operators. However, please check your roaming costs as this can be expensive. You can purchase a pre-paid sim card at the airport just outside of arrivals. Skype or similar programs can be used however the internet speeds can be intermittent throughout the Maldives.</p>
